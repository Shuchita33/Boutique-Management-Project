# Boutique-Management-Project
It is a management system that provides a common platform for customers,employees and employer to access the services.

I have used database named sboutique which is used to store data and perform other operations.

It allows customers to create/sign in to their account and see/book/cancel products and appointments as well as delete their account.

Employees can login to their accounts to check and update their bookings and appointments.

Employers can add new products, view/update product details and add/remove employees.
